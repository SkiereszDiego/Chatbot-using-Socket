# Chatbot-using-Socket
Senac-RS - Sistemas Distribuidos. Exercice to use Socket to build a simple chatbot that will repeat the sentence you talk to it. 


What is Socket?
We can think as endpoints in a communication channel that is bi-directional. Using this tool we can build a Server port and a Client port in different computers, and then we can connect them and send messages by each other.

In Python language, there is a package named "socket", and we don't use any command to install it, just import.
